The chart is just an empty chart.  
The main feature of the app is not working, which is rendering the historical data of exchange prices.  
That's because I couldn't find a free API that gives me historical prices.  
These examples:

1. https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/
   The free tier is without historical data

2. https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api/pricing
   Free Tier daily requests is 100 only, which is not suffiecient for development

3. https://fixer.io/#pricing_plan
   Free Tier daily requests is 100 only, which is not suffiecient for development
